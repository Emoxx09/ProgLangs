# ProgLangs
A collection of snippets from different programming languages of imperative and declarative type. Namely; C, C++, LISP, and Javascript.

#### C

After the creation of B, C followed. Created by Dennies Ritchie in 1972, C is a general purpose programming language 
that is built to run on Unix. It gradually gained popularity overtime.

#### C++

After the development of Objective-C, Bjarne Stroustrup went to create
C++. Revered as ‘C with Classes’, this language has expanded significantly
overtime being widely used in modern times for different purposes such as
research, development, and even popularly in competitive programming.

#### LISP

John McCarthy developed this at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT). It was designed to be used by scientific computers of the IBM 700/7000
series. Its functions were defined using Church’s lambda notation.

#### Javascript

While working at Netscape Communications Corporation, Brendan Eich created Javascript, one of the most famously 
used web languages often integrated with HTML and CSS. It was created as a lanauge to be utilized by Mosaic, one of 
the first web browsers at the time. As years go by, the language was improved upon and adopted into many platforms.

Using these languages, I written programs in each language that:

• Computes the sum of numbers in an array

• Computes the average of numbers in an array

• Lists down the numbers that are less than 10 in an array
